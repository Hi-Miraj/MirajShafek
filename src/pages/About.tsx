                I'm Miraj Shafek, a 17-year-old high school student, AI/ML developer, public health researcher, 
                and entrepreneur passionate about revolutionizing healthcare through technology. As the 
                Co-founder & CFO of MedVisual, I lead financial strategy and business growth while 
                contributing to AI-driven innovations that make healthcare smarter and more accessible.
              </p>

              <p>
                Currently, I'm a Research Intern at Statice Health, where I work on healthcare research 
                projects aimed at improving accessibility and innovation in public health.
              </p>

              <p>
                My journey began with robotics and programming, where I explored machine learning, computer 
                vision, and AI applications. Over time, I shifted my focus to public health, recognizing the 
                gaps in healthcare accessibilityâ€”especially in underserved communities. This led me to 
                co-create MedVisual, Bangladesh's first AI-powered healthcare ecosystem, integrating medical 
                report digitization, predictive analytics, telemedicine, and e-pharmacy into a single platform.
              </p>
